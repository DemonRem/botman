This command help is taken directly from the bot.  It is not a manual but you will learn a lot just exploring this text.

/reload code
Tell the bot to reload all external Lua scripts. This also happens shortly after restarting the bot and it can automatically detect if the scripts are not loaded and reload them.
Once the script have loaded, if you make any changes to them you need to run this command or restart the bot for your changes to take effect.

/pause bot
Temporarily disable the bot. It will still read the chat and can be enabled again.

*Note:  The command sections below are not currently in alphabetical order. Also your bot will be missing some commands if it is using an older code branch.

Unslashed Commands:

Unslashed commands are simply words in normal chat that trigger a response from the bot.

Your bot will react to any player using the words hack, cheat, grief or flying. That triggers a special scan for hackers.
Any players with a non-zero hacker score found near the player will be immediately exiled. If you don't have the exile location set up, nothing will happen.

When feral. Like /day7, the bot will report how many days remain until a horde night.
When reboot. The bot will report how long until the next reboot.

restart bot
If your bot is launched from a custom script with the ability to restart itself, you can command your bot to restart.
All of Smegz0r's hosted bots have this feature. Contact Smeg if you need help adding it to your bot.

/set base deadzone {distance}
Block players setting their base too close to the base of another player who has not friended them.

/set base2 size {number} {player name}
Set the base protection size for a player's first or second base.

Unless you intend players to fall, do not fly or clip through objects while recording.  To stop recording just type stop.
You can record random spawns anywhere and more than once but remember to type stop after each recording or the bot will continue recording your movement and making spawn points from them.
The spawns do not have to be inside the location and you can make groups of spawns anywhere in the world for the location.

/location set reset {name}
Flag the location as a reset zone.  The bot will warn players not to build in it and will block /setbase and will remove placed claims of non-staff.

If you are not on the ground, make sure the players can survive the landing.  If there are existing random spawns for the location, moving it will not move them.
You should clear them and redo them using /location {name} clear and /location {name} random.

/location lobby/not lobby {name}
Flag the location as the lobby or not the lobby. New players will be sent to this location when they spawn if it is flagged as lobby.  Only one location will be used so flagging more will not make them all the lobby.
To do that use /set tp {location}.  This will add a random teleport destination for the location.  You can set as many as you want.

The bot can automatically restart itself after running for days. The restart helps fix issues and keeps the bot fresh.
The default is 7 days between bot restarts. You can disable it by setting it to 0. Also it will only activate if bot restarts are enabled.

/set warn colour {hex code}
Set the colour of server warning messages.

/set command prefix / (or no symbol or any symbol except \ )
Change bot commands from using / to using nothing or another symbol.

/set master password {secret password up to 50 characters}
Protect important commands such as /reset bot with a password.
This will prevent you or another server owner from accidentally doing something stupid (hopefully).
To remove it use /clear master password.

/set update branch
Bot updates are released in code branches such as stable and testing.  The stable branch will not update as often and should have less issues than testing.
New and trial features will release to testing before stable. Important fixes will be ported to stable from testing whenever possible.
You can switch between branches as often as you want.  Any changes in testing that are not in stable will never break stable should you switch back to it.

/shutdown bot
While not essential as it seems to work just fine, you can tell the bot to save all pending player data, before you quit Mudlet.Note: This doesn't actually stop the bot. It only ensures that everything has been saved so you can manually shutdown Mudlet.

/set bot chatty/quiet
If you want to stop the bot responding to 'hi bot' and be more utilitarian, you can set the bot to be quiet.

/enable/disable bot restart
Using a launcher script or some other monitoring process you can have the bot automatically restart itself every time it terminates.
Periodically restarting the bot helps to keep it running at its best.
This feature is disabled by default.  A restart script can be downloaded from http://botman.nz/shellscripts.zip
You will need to inspect and modify some paths in the scripts to match your setup.

/enable/disable updates (disabled by default)
Allow the bot to automatically update itself by downloading scripts. It will check daily, but you can also command it to check immediately with /update bot

/enable/disable level hack check
Hackers can give themselves XP but normal play and/or game bugs can also cause large level changes.
The level check could falsely report legit level changes as hacking so this is disabled by default.
If you enable it and innocent players get banned, either unban them or turn it off again.

/enable/disable hacker tp detection
Some mods or managers don't report legit teleports to telnet which breaks the bot's hacker teleport detection.
If the bot doesn't automatically disable/enable hacker tp detection, you can manually change it.

/show/hide unknown command
If the bot doesn't recognise a command it will respond with 'Unknown command'.  You can hide that message if you want.

/enable/disable lag check (enabled by default)
Every 10 seconds while connected to the server, the bot sends a special lag check command to the server and times the response.
If the bot detects more than 10 seconds delay, it will automatically suspend several bot functions to reduce the number of commands that it sends to the server.
You can disable this check, but your bot won't pause for lag and the server could get significantly behind during busy times.

/enable/disable bot command log (disabled by default)
For debugging purposes, commands sent to the server by the bot can be logged just like player commands but to its own log file.
This will include sensitive information such as passwords so don't enable this if anyone has access to it that you don't want reading it.
Only server owners can enable this log.

/enable/disable inventory log. (disabled by default)
The bot logs inventory and inventory changes to the database all the time.  You can also have inventory changes recorded to a daily text file along with the other daily logs.

/use telnet (this is the default now but the API is planned to become the new default soon)
/use api
The bot communicates with the server using telnet. It can use Allocs web API instead.

/update code
Make the bot check for script updates.  They will be installed if you have set /enable updates

/no reset
If the bot detects that the server days have rolled back, it will ask you if you want to reset the bot.  Type /no reset if you don't want the bot to reset itself.

/reset server
Tell the bot to forget everything it knows about the server.  You will be asked to confirm this, answer with yes.  Say anything else to abort.
Usually you only need to use /reset bot.  This reset goes further.

/archive players
Archive players that haven't played in 60 days, aren't staff, banned, or a donor.

Note: This uses Google and due to the number of bots I host, it is not installed on my servers as I don't want to risk an invoice from them.

Shutting down the bot will also cancel a reboot but any automatic (timed) reboots will reschedule if the server wasn't also restarted.

/override access {number from 99 to 4}
All players have an access level which governs what they can do.  You can override it for everyone to temporarily raise their access.
eg. /overide access 10 would make all players donors until you restore it.  To do that type /override access 99.  This is faster than giving individual players donor access if you just want to do a free donor weekend.

/set map size {number}
Set the maximum distance from 0,0 that players are allowed to travel. Any players already outside this limit will be teleported to 0,0 and may get stuck under the map.  They can relog.
Size is in metres (blocks) and be careful not to set it too small.  The default map size is 10000 but the bot's default is 20000.
Whatever size you set, donors will be able to travel 5km futher out so the true boundary is +5000.

/set max animals {number}
Change the server's max spawned animals.

/set (or clear) max ping {number}
To kick high ping players set a max ping.  It will only be applied to new players. You can also whitelist a new player to make them exempt.

Note: Does not apply to exempt players which includes admins, donors and individuals that have been bot whitelisted.

/set prison timer {number} (in minutes)
Set how long someone stays in prison when jailed by the bot.  To not have a time limit, set this to 0 which is the default.

/set pvp cooldown {seconds}
Set how long after a pvp kill before the player can use teleport commands again.

You can have a number of server slots reserved for admins and selected players.

To disable, set reserved slots to 0.

/set rolling delay {minutes}
Set the delay in minutes between rolling announcements.

Your API key is not recorded in logs or the databases and no bot command reports it.  It is used to determine if a player has voted for your server today.
While the bot takes precautions to keep your API key a secret, you should be careful not to type it anywhere in public.  The safest place to give it to the bot is in private chat on IRC or on the bot's web interface when that is available.

/set server group {group name} (one word)
This is used by the bots database which could be a cloud database.  It is used to identify this bot as belonging to a group if you have more than one server.  You do not need to set this.

/set server ip {IP of your 7 Days to Die server}
