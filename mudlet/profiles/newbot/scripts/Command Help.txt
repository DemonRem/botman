This command help is taken directly from the bot.  It is not a manual but you will learn a lot just exploring this text.

/reload code
Tell the bot to reload all external Lua scripts. This also happens shortly after restarting the bot and it can automatically detect if the scripts are not loaded and reload them.
Once the script have loaded, if you make any changes to them you need to run this command or restart the bot for your changes to take effect.

/pause bot
Temporarily disable the bot. It will still read the chat and can be enabled again.

*Note:  The command sections below are not currently in alphabetical order. Also your bot will be missing some commands if it is using an older code branch.

Unslashed Commands:

Unslashed commands are simply words in normal chat that trigger a response from the bot.

Your bot will react to any player using the words hack, cheat, grief or flying. That triggers a special scan for hackers.
Any players with a non-zero hacker score found near the player will be immediately exiled. If you don't have the exile location set up, nothing will happen.

When feral. Like /day7, the bot will report how many days remain until a horde night.
When reboot. The bot will report how long until the next reboot.

restart bot
If your bot is launched from a custom script with the ability to restart itself, you can command your bot to restart.
All of Smegz0r's hosted bots have this feature. Contact Smeg if you need help adding it to your bot.

Restricted to owners, admins and mods in-game and IRC

/restore backup {optional backup number} {optional words: bases, cash, donors, colors, locations, waypoints, friends, villagers, teleports, hotspots, resets, players}
/restore backup {optional backup number} {optional words as above} player {name or steam or player id} (note: player {name} must be specified last)
The bot saves its Lua tables daily at midnight (server time) and each time the server is shut down.
If the bot gets messed up, you can try to fix it with this command. Other timestamped backups are made before the bot is reset but you will first need to strip the date part off them to restore with this command.
To only restore player bases, add the word bases, for cash add cash and for donors add donors. If these words are included, nothing else is restored.
You can also just restore 1 named player.
To see a list of backups use /list backups.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/set api log read {interval in seconds} (default 3 seconds)
In API mode the bot will read the server log at regular intervals with the default being every 3 seconds.
You can set a longer delay but the bot won't respond to in-game commands faster than the delay that you set.
If you think the polling interval is causing server lag you can try slowing it down.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

Set what happens to blacklisted players.  The default is to ban them 10 years but if you create a location called exile, the bot can bannish them to there instead.  It acts like a prison.

Restricted to owners and admins in-game and IRC

/set command prefix / (or no symbol or any symbol except \ )
Change bot commands from using / to using nothing or another symbol.
Restricted to owners and admins in-game and IRC

/set lag check {seconds}
If lag checking is enabled, the bot will send lag check messages to the server which are timed.  If the time delay from sending the message to reading it back exceeds this threshold, the bot will temporarily suspend some bot commands sent to the server regularly.
The default is 15 seconds.  If bot commands are not working for a long time, it could be repeatedly flagging the server as lagged.  You can disable the lag check, but if the lag is real it could get longer over time.
Setting a very low number will probably make the bot think the server is constantly lagged.  The bot will unflag the server lag every 10 seconds to prevent the bot getting stuck thinking the server is lagged.
Restricted to owners, admins and mods in-game and IRC

/set master password {secret password up to 50 characters}
Protect important commands such as /reset bot with a password.
This will prevent you or another server owner from accidentally doing something stupid (hopefully).
To remove it use /clear master password.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/set max log days {number}
The default is 14 days. Setting this too long will result in lots of log files on disk.
To prevent this causing issues on my hosted bots, the max you can set this is 60 days.
To set it higher you need to edit telnetlogkeepdays in the server table in the database.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/set update branch
Bot updates are released in code branches such as stable and testing.  The stable branch will not update as often and should have less issues than testing.

You can switch between branches as often as you want.  Any changes in testing that are not in stable will never break stable should you switch back to it.
Restricted to owners, admins and mods in-game and IRC

/shutdown bot
While not essential as it seems to work just fine, you can tell the bot to save all pending player data, before you quit Mudlet.Note: This doesn't actually stop the bot. It only ensures that everything has been saved so you can manually shutdown Mudlet.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/set bot chatty/quiet

Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/enable/disable bot restart
Using a launcher script or some other monitoring process you can have the bot automatically restart itself every time it terminates.
Periodically restarting the bot helps to keep it running at its best.

You will need to inspect and modify some paths in the scripts to match your setup.

Restricted to owners, admins and mods in-game and IRC

/enable/disable level hack check
Hackers can give themselves XP but normal play and/or game bugs can also cause large level changes.
The level check could falsely report legit level changes as hacking so this is disabled by default.
If you enable it and innocent players get banned, either unban them or turn it off again.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/enable/disable hacker tp detection
Some mods or managers don't report legit teleports to telnet which breaks the bot's hacker teleport detection.
If the bot doesn't automatically disable/enable hacker tp detection, you can manually change it.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/show/hide unknown command
If the bot doesn't recognise a command it will respond with 'Unknown command'.  You can hide that message if you want.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/enable/disable lag check (enabled by default)
Every 10 seconds while connected to the server, the bot sends a special lag check command to the server and times the response.
If the bot detects more than 10 seconds delay, it will automatically suspend several bot functions to reduce the number of commands that it sends to the server.
You can disable this check, but your bot won't pause for lag and the server could get significantly behind during busy times.
Restricted to owners, admins and mods in-game and IRC

/enable/disable bot command log (disabled by default)
For debugging purposes, commands sent to the server by the bot can be logged just like player commands but to its own log file.

Only server owners can enable this log.

/read log using api
Due to ongoing issues with the API log reader skipping lines the default is that in API mode, the bot will monitor the server via telnet.
If telnet is disabled or you tell the bot to read the log using the API, then it will monitor the server via the API.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/enable/disable telnet fallback (default is disabled)
When the bot is using Alloc's web API, if the API becomes unreachable the bot will stop using the API and switch to telnet only if telnet fallback is enabled.
The default behaviour is to keep using the API. Previously the default was to fallback to telnet.
Note that the bot should not confuse the server being offline with the API not working as it checks API and telnet activity before making the switch.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/use telnet (this is the default now but the API is planned to become the new default soon)
/use api
The bot communicates with the server using telnet. It can use Allocs web API instead.
Restricted to server owners in-game and IRC

/update code
Make the bot check for script updates.  They will be installed if you have set /enable updates
Restricted to owners, admins and mods in-game and IRC
